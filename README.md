# Bioinformatics project

This repository contains **two distinct projects** developed as part of the CEID Bioinformatics lesson.

##  Project 1: Bioinformatics Algorithms & Tool Exploration

**Description:**  
In this project, you will explore fundamental algorithms and tools used in modern bioinformatics. You’ll get hands‑on experience with:

- **Protein structure prediction**  
  - Quick surveys of AlphaFold, ColabFold and ESMFold  
  - Short usage reports on each tool’s basic functionality  

- **Sequence similarity search**  
  - Running a BLASTP query against NCBI’s protein database  
  - Retrieving, formatting and saving top hits in FASTA  

- **Multiple sequence alignment (MSA)**  
  - Aligning a set of related protein sequences with MAFFT, MUSCLE and T‑COFFEE  
  - Comparing output formats and discussing alignment quality  

- **String‑sequence algorithms**  
  - Proving and implementing the LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) relationship to weighted edit distance  
  - Dynamic‑programming solutions for global and local alignment  
  - Suffix‑tree approaches to maximal repeats and common prefixes  

- **Biopython exercises**  
  - Automating BLASTP queries and sequence retrieval  
  - Generating pairwise and multiple alignments programmatically  
  - Saving alignments in standard formats (`.fasta`, `.aln`)

##  Project 2: Research Review on Machine‑Learning for Liver Disease

**Description:**  
This research project provides a **literature survey** of recent machine‑learning approaches to **liver disease detection and prognosis**. 

1. **Predictive modeling from clinical signals**  
   - Approaches using time‑series data (e.g., ECG traces) to infer liver pathology  
   - Emphasis on externally validated, interpretable models  

2. **Self‑supervised and texture‑based imaging**  
   - Techniques that learn feature representations from CT or MRI scans without heavy annotation  
   - Texture encoding and pre‑training strategies for fibrosis and steatosis scoring  

3. **Deep‑learning on cross‑modality data**  
   - Convolutional neural networks applied to CT images for metastasis risk prediction in oncology  
   - Integration of imaging features with clinical metadata  

4. **Model explainability & validation**  
   - Use of explainable ML to identify which image regions or signal patterns drive predictions  
   - External cohort validations to assess generalizability
